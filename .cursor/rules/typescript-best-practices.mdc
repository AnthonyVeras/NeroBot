- Use strict null checks to catch potential null or undefined errors
- Prefer interfaces over types for better extensibility and reusability
- Utilize type guards and assertions to narrow types and improve type safety
- Leverage type inference to reduce unnecessary type annotations
- Use readonly properties and const assertions to enforce immutability
